                        I found a passion for coding
                        in my late 20's, and I am aspiring to build a career as a Web Developer. I'm not some
                        rock star coding wizard, but I take pride in the fact that Iâ€™m a good, solid programmer.
                        One who loves working on his craft, and embracing the journey.
